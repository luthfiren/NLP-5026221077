# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

This repository contains the work I developed throughout my **Natural Language Processing (NLP) lecture project**.  
It includes the datasets used and Jupyter notebooks that document my experiments and learning progress across the semester.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project explores fundamental concepts and applications in NLP, including:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, stemming)
- Feature extraction (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Text classification tasks
- Sentiment analysis
- Sequence models (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
- Transformer-based approaches (BERT and its variants)
